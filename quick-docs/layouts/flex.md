# Flex Layout #

## Overview ##
As stated in **W3C Recommendation** [_CSS Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1_][w3c_flex-box-mod1]:
> Flex layout is superficially similar to block layout. It lacks many of the more complex text- or document-centric  
>  properties that can be used in block layout, such as floats and columns. In return it gains simple and powerful  
>  tools for distributing space and aligning content in ways that web apps and complex web pages often need. The  
>  contents of a flex container:
>
>  *  can be laid out in any flow direction (leftwards, rightwards, downwards, or even upwards!)
>  *  can have their display order reversed or rearranged at the style layer (i.e., visual order can be independent of source and speech order)
>  *  can be laid out linearly along a single (main) axis or wrapped into multiple lines along a secondary (cross) axis
>  *  can “flex” their sizes to respond to the available space
>  *  can be aligned with respect to their container or each other on the secondary (cross)
>  *  can be dynamically collapsed or uncollapsed along the main axis while preserving the container’s cross size
